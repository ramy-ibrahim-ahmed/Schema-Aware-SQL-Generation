## Objective

---

## Guidelines
- Base your reasoning **solely** on the provided structure and sample data.  
- Ensure the query is **syntactically valid SQLite**.   
- The query should be **accurate**, **minimal**, and **directly** answer the user's question.  
- Do **not** include explanations, reasoning steps, or extra commentary â€” just the query in the required format.
